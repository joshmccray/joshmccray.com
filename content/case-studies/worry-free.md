## Overview

I led the creative direction for Jockey's "Worry Free" product launch—a specialized underwear line designed for period protection. This project showcased the full spectrum of design work: branding development, custom illustration, icon design, and full-stack web development.

## The Challenge

Period products occupy a unique space—they need to balance technical credibility with emotional reassurance. The marketing needed to:
- Explain product features clearly (absorption levels, layering system)
- Build trust through education
- Create an emotional connection with the brand
- Feel modern and approachable, not clinical

## My Role

I wore multiple hats on this project:
- **Creative Direction** - Art directed all marketing materials
- **Illustration** - Designed custom icons and diagrams
- **Design** - Created landing page layouts and user experiences
- **Development** - Coded the responsive marketing pages

## Design Approach

### Technical Communication

Created illustrated diagrams explaining:
- **Absorption Levels** - Visual comparison showing "how much each pair absorbs"
- **Layering System** - Cross-section illustrations demonstrating the technology

These weren't just pretty graphics—they were educational tools that built confidence in the product.

### Emotional Exploration

Developed an alternate design direction "focused on emotion" rather than technical specifications. This version emphasized:
- Empowerment and confidence
- Peace of mind
- Freedom and movement
- Connection to the Jockey brand heritage

### Web Development

Designed and coded responsive landing pages that:
- Showcased product benefits clearly
- Guided users through the decision-making process
- Maintained brand consistency with Jockey's main site
- Performed well on mobile and desktop

## Deliverables

- Complete brand identity for Worry Free line
- Custom icon set and illustration system
- Educational diagrams and infographics
- Responsive landing pages (designed and developed)
- Marketing collateral and campaign assets

## Results

The campaign successfully launched Jockey into the period care market with a confident, modern presence. The landing pages effectively communicated both the technical innovation and emotional benefits of the product line.

## Key Learnings

This project reinforced that **good design serves the user's needs first**. In this case, users needed both rational information (technical specs) and emotional reassurance (you'll feel confident). By balancing these needs, we created a campaign that educated and empowered.

Being able to both design and code the landing pages allowed for tighter creative control and faster iteration—proof that cross-disciplinary skills create better outcomes.
