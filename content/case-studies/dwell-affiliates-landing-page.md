## Overview

When Dwell launched their affiliate program, they needed a landing page that would attract content creators, influencers, and ministry partners. I designed and developed a page that clearly communicated the program benefits while making it easy for potential affiliates to sign up.

## The Challenge

Affiliate programs succeed or fail based on clarity. Potential partners need to quickly understand:
- What they'll earn (commission structure)
- How it works (the process)
- Who it's for (ideal partners)
- Why they should trust the program (brand credibility)

The landing page had to answer all these questions while maintaining Dwell's premium brand aesthetic.

## Target Audience

The affiliate program targeted:
- **Ministry Leaders** - Pastors, Bible study leaders, spiritual directors
- **Content Creators** - Christian bloggers, podcasters, YouTubers
- **Influencers** - Faith-based social media personalities
- **Organizations** - Churches, retreat centers, Christian conferences

Each segment had different motivations and questions, so the page needed to speak to multiple audiences without becoming cluttered.

## Design Approach

### Information Architecture

Organized content in a logical flow:
1. **Hero Section** - Immediate value proposition
2. **Program Benefits** - What affiliates receive
3. **How It Works** - Step-by-step process
4. **Commission Structure** - Clear earning potential
5. **Who It's For** - Ideal partner profiles
6. **Sign Up CTA** - Direct path to enrollment

Created a cohesive visual experience using:

- **Iconography** - Custom icons for program benefits
- **Layout Compositions** - Varied section designs to maintain engagement

## Key Learnings

**Clarity over cleverness.** Affiliate landing pages need to be straightforward. Potential partners are evaluating a business opportunity—they need facts, not marketing fluff.

**Design builds trust.** A professionally designed page signals that the company takes the program seriously and will support its partners well. Visual quality directly impacts conversion.

**Mobile optimization matters.** Many content creators discover affiliate opportunities on mobile devices. The page had to work perfectly on small screens.

Handling both design and development ensured the final product matched the creative vision exactly, with no "lost in translation" moments between design and implementation.
