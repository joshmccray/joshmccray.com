  problem: "Compassion had no way for donors to fund specific, community-led projects. Giving was limited to child sponsorship and general funds—donors couldn't see or choose the tangible initiatives their money would support."
  solution: "A crowdfunding platform where local churches post causes directly, donors browse and fund specific projects, and every dollar reaches the community."
