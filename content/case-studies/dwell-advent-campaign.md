## Overview

For Dwell's Advent season, I designed and developed a multi-touchpoint marketing campaign centered around an Advent devotional. The project spanned landing pages, email marketing, and promotional materials—all working together to drive app downloads and deepen user engagement during the Christmas season.

## The Challenge

Advent is a critical season for faith-based apps like Dwell. The challenge was to:
- Capture attention during a busy holiday season
- Convert casual interest into app downloads
- Sustain engagement across four weeks
- Provide value that extended beyond the campaign

## Campaign Components

### Landing Page

Built a dedicated landing page (Ruby on Rails) focused on email collection:
- Clean, seasonal design aesthetic
- Clear value proposition for the Advent devotional PDF
- Simple email capture form
- Immediate PDF delivery upon signup

### Four-Week Email Series

Designed and developed an automated email sequence that:
- **Week 1** - Welcome and introduction to Advent themes
- **Week 2** - Additional verses and reflection prompts
- **Week 3** - Prayers and encouragement
- **Week 4** - Looking toward Christmas and sustained app usage

Each email included:
- Beautiful seasonal imagery
- Relevant scripture and devotional content
- Clear calls-to-action for app downloads
- Shareable content for social media

### Church Partnership Materials

Created promotional slides for church accounts, enabling:
- Easy promotion to congregations
- Consistent messaging across partners
- Simple participation path for church members

## Technical Implementation

- **Platform:** Ruby on Rails
- **Email Automation:** Integrated email delivery system
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for mobile and desktop
- **Analytics:** Tracking for campaign performance

## Design Approach

The visual design balanced:
- **Seasonal warmth** - Christmas aesthetics without being overly commercial
- **Spiritual focus** - Keeping the sacred nature of Advent central
- **Modern accessibility** - Contemporary design that appeals to younger audiences
- **Brand consistency** - Maintaining Dwell's established visual identity

## Campaign Timeline

- **December 2020** - Campaign launch
- **Four weeks** - Weekly email deployment
- **January 2021** - Campaign conclusion and analysis

## Results

The campaign successfully engaged subscribers throughout the Advent season, driving app downloads and creating touchpoints that extended beyond a single interaction. The multi-week structure allowed for relationship building rather than one-time conversion.

## Key Learnings

**Sustained engagement beats one-time conversion.** By spreading the campaign across four weeks, we created multiple opportunities to connect with users and demonstrate Dwell's ongoing value.

**Integration matters.** The campaign's strength came from how all pieces worked together—landing pages driving email signups, emails promoting app features, church materials expanding reach. Each touchpoint reinforced the others.

Being able to design and develop the entire campaign allowed for faster iteration and tighter integration between creative vision and technical execution.
