## Overview

During my first year at Compassion, I worked on the organization's design system—a collaborative effort that brought together designers, developers, and stakeholders across the globe. As I always say, "It feels wrong to include a design system in my portfolio. A design system is in no way a one-person job." This project exemplifies the power of teamwork and strategic thinking.

## The Challenge

Compassion International is a global organization serving multiple teams with different technology stacks (iOS, .NET, React) and marketing campaigns. The challenge was clear: **How might we create a flexible design system that adapts across diverse contexts while maintaining consistency?**

The traditional approach—building separate component libraries for each platform—would create maintenance nightmares and brand inconsistencies. We needed something smarter.

## Solution: Design Tokens Architecture

We implemented a three-tier token structure that separates concerns and enables powerful theming capabilities:

### 1. Core Tokens
The complete pool of potential design values—colors, typography, spacing, shadows, and more. Think of these as your design DNA.

### 2. Semantic Tokens
This is where theming magic happens. Using names like `background-color-primary` and `text-color-interactive`, semantic tokens create meaningful relationships between design decisions and their implementation.

### 3. Component Tokens
Component-specific values drawn from semantic tokens with consistent naming conventions, making it easy for developers to implement designs correctly every time.

## The Power of Theming

This architecture enables Compassion to:
- Serve different brands with the same component library
- Support light and dark modes effortlessly
- Maintain consistency across iOS, .NET, and React platforms
- Quickly spin up themed campaigns without rebuilding components

## Deliverables

- **Figma Component Library** powered by design tokens
- **Token Documentation** with usage guidelines
- **Implementation Guides** for each platform
- **Onboarding Materials** for new teams

## Adoption Strategy

Successful adoption requires more than great design—it requires relationships. I facilitate onboarding for new teams, working with Compassion's global partners to customize system implementation. We even created stickers to build awareness and excitement around the system.

## Key Learnings

The most important insight? **The importance of collaboration and early adoption.** We invested heavily in relationship-building and communication. In hindsight, more awareness-building earlier could have prevented certain obstacles, but the strong foundation of trust we built made every challenge surmountable.

## Impact

Today, the design system powers Compassion's digital experiences across platforms and brands, enabling faster development, consistent user experiences, and scalable growth for a global organization serving children in need.
