  problem: "Compassion's checkout process needed modernization during a rebrand—express checkout options were buried, donation types were presented inconsistently, and the flow had unnecessary friction."
  solution: "A redesigned checkout experience that elevates express payment options, standardizes donation type presentation, and simplifies form interactions to reduce abandonment."

## Overview

Compassion's checkout process had historically performed well, but as the organization underwent a rebrand and website refactoring, it was time to modernize the experience. The goal wasn't to fix what was broken—it was to elevate what was working and prepare it for the future.

## Project Objectives

The redesign addressed three core objectives:

### 1. Express Checkout Enhancement
Elevate the prominence of express checkout options (Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal) while future-proofing for diverse payment integrations. Users want fast, secure checkout—we needed to make it obvious and accessible.

### 2. Donation Type Standardization
Reduce complexity by creating uniform presentation of donation options. Whether sponsoring a child, contributing to a fund, or sending a gift, the experience should feel familiar and reduce cognitive load.

### 3. Checkout Flow Optimization
Simplify form interactions and reduce transaction steps to create a frictionless checkout. Every unnecessary click is a chance for users to abandon their donation.

## Key Components

### The Donation Card

Created a versatile card component accommodating multiple donation types:
- Child sponsorships
- Fund contributions
- Gift catalog items
- Upsell opportunities

The design abstracts internal terminology, speaking in user-friendly language while maintaining system flexibility on the backend.

### Order Summary Drawer

Standardized cart item cards into a cohesive summary interface. We tested with maximum add-on scenarios to ensure the design held up under stress—because real users don't add just one item.

### Secondary Actions Drawer

Moved secondary actions (adding payments, signing in, editing amounts) into a drawer/modal pattern. This approach:
- Reduced form field density on the main screen
- Improved task flexibility and focus
- Created clearer visual hierarchy
- Made mobile interactions more intuitive

## The Process

I refined inherited business requirements and wireframes, asking critical questions:
- Are these requirements still relevant?
- What new dependencies have emerged?
- How should we test these changes?
- What metrics define success?

## Results

**Testing Results:** Coming soon - pending launch and data collection.

## Key Learnings

The checkout redesign reinforced that **good UX is invisible**. Users shouldn't think about the interface—they should think about the impact of their donation. Every design decision prioritized clarity, speed, and confidence in the transaction.

When dealing with donations, trust is paramount. The new design maintains Compassion's trustworthy presence while meeting modern user expectations for digital transactions.
