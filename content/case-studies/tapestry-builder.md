## Overview

Tapestry Builder is an innovative tool developed for Compassion International's rebrand initiative. The platform leverages over 5,000 illustrations created by children in the field—later vectorized by designers—to enable users to construct personalized tapestries.

These compositions serve multiple purposes: marketing materials, customized merchandise, and storytelling vehicles designed to strengthen connections between program sponsors and the children they support.

## The Challenge

**How might we allow users to build tapestries that represent them, using our children's illustrations?**

The challenge was two-fold:
1. Create an intuitive experience that makes complex composition feel simple
2. Use AI to personalize selections while maintaining human creativity and choice

## The Process

### Ideation Phase

The project commenced with comprehensive ideation incorporating:
- **Workshopping sessions** with stakeholders and potential users
- **Competitive research** analyzing similar creative tools
- **Wireframing** to explore interaction patterns

While mobile-first design was prioritized for prototyping and testing, responsive adaptations for desktop viewing were also validated to ensure flexibility across devices.

### Minimum Lovable Product

Budget constraints and prototype testing complexities led us to develop an interactive coded version rather than relying on Figma prototypes. This approach had a key innovation:

Instead of building actual AI functionality for the prototype, we created an extensive question library and branching narrative logic to simulate personalization. This allowed us to test the experience and value proposition without the development overhead of training AI models.

## Design Decisions

The experience balances guided curation with creative freedom:
- Users answer questions about their interests, values, and aesthetics
- The system suggests relevant illustrations based on responses
- Users can accept suggestions or browse the full library
- Real-time preview shows how selections come together
- Final tapestries can be downloaded, ordered as prints, or shared

## Next Steps

Following initial testing completion, the team plans to advance through:
1. **Validation** - Refining based on user feedback
2. **Development** - Building production-ready AI integration
3. **Delivery** - Launching to sponsors and partners
4. **Evaluation** - Measuring impact on engagement and connection

## Impact Potential

By transforming children's artwork into personalized experiences, Tapestry Builder creates tangible touchpoints that remind sponsors of their impact while celebrating the creativity and individuality of the children they support.
